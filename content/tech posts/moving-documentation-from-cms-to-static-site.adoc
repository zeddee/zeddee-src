Hosted our documentation on Confluence.

Other CMS solutions considered:

* wordpress
* drupal
* other online solutions

Problems:

* dependence on more layers of software
  -* database
  -* graphical admin interface
  -* wysiwyg editors

using confluence:

* purchased theming
* did not purchase documentation-related plugins
* good points:
  ** quick writing
  ** no build times
  ** content trees are easy to manage
* pain points:
  ** wysiwyg editor unreliable. input would be parsed, output not just unpredictable, but would change slightly from input
  ** no built in editorial workflow
    *** comments could be seen publicly.
    *** resolved comments could still be searched.
    *** no way to remove once a comment is made.
    *** moving pages from space to space would break many things. this precluded being able to write in a private space and then move the content to a public space
    *** permissions were buggy. moving content from a private space to a public space was problematic because restricted permissions would be invisibly ported over at an object level. e.g. move page from private to public space, but images would not display because permissions for images in page itself would remain private until explicitly changed.
    *** conclusion: cannot write in confluence; had to write privately and then copy/paste content
