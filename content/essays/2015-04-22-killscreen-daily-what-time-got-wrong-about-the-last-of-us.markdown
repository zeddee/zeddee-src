[![Zed, "What Time Got Wrong About The Last of Us"](/img/zed-killscreen-last-of-us.jpg)](#)

> You’re not going to find deep-sea fish if you’re staring between your legs while knee deep in the neighbour’s wading pool. And you’re probably not going to get [gripping photographs](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2002/04/afghan-girl/index-text) of dust-covered residents of a post-apocalyptic Boston if you’re sending your photographer into a videogame.

That’s the sort of misunderstanding that typically comes out of traditional media outlets attempting to import their practices and modes of production into a medium that it does not particularly lend itself to. But TIME Magazine tried to do just that.</blockquote>
