George Orwell's woke novel is an everyman's introduction to one of the potential outcomes -- _reductio ad absurdum_ -- of a "bad emperor" having come to power in a highly connected world. 

It's less illuminative than instructive: it's a primer on why you should care about data privacy, and the importance of paying attention to how you appear on the grid.
