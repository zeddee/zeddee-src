I found out that the National Library extended the average user's borrowing privileges, allowing them to borrow probably 60% more books than they usually could. Because I was sitting at 12 borrowed books at one time and desperately wanted to take home a well-worn issue of _LUCKY PEACH_ (on ugly foods, if I remember correctly), I did my part as an active citizen and actually paid for a premium library membership -- which has led to todays situation where I stand at a balance of 33/50 books borrowed.

```Not pictured: an unruly pile of books that's creeping across the floor.```



This, of course, makes up less than a tenth of the books that are actually in my room.

It also makes the title of this post sound pretty rich. But let me explain myself.

<!-- I know I have a problem: I've recently sat in a job interview where I attempted to regale my potential employers with how much I kwow about the post-structural theories of space and its construction. I was being very much verbose self (as whoever's managed to stay friends with me can attest to). I _actually talk like this on a day to day basis_, because this is the voice I have in my head telling me to do things, which means that trying to say the same things but in a straightforward manner for me is right now like _speaking in another bloody language_. Which is not a good thing. -->

I've spent the last two years buried in books because I've always felt that I haven't read enough. You know the endless abyss that's the infinte Wiki trawl (clicking Wiki link after link)? That happens to me with books. What people usually spend on food and alcohol I spend on books (and expensive books at that). The unnerving part is this: that as much as I know I am making progress with the hardest and most obscure ideas in the world through the thousands of pages that sit on my shelves and desk(s), I know it will not matter to anyone until I make something.

That hasn't happened in 2 years. So maybe it'll happen this year if I read less. Maybe.
