I've been thinking about shame — both personal shame, and shame as an _existentiale_, or a fundamental mode of existence — for a long time. The thought starts off vague, of course, with a personal sense of shame that is often evoked when presented with embarassment, inexplicable sense of otherness, etc. that is typical of the experience of growing up as an outsider. It was when I encountered Haneke's _Caché_ and read Catherine Wheatley's essay "Shame and Guilt" (Wheatley, 2009) that the idea that shame (and guilt) is not necessarily personal, not necessarily intrinsic in the person that holds it, clicked.

It's been a while since then, but it's fascinating to be able examine shame through this strange lens. Once you begin to understand that shame is something that is as much environmentally inflicted as intrinsically motivated, it's interesting to take apart the situations in which it — shame — appears.
