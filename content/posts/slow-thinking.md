At the end of 2013, was triapsing around London in the dead of winter. Wanted to grab a meal at a sandwich shop along the street. Perused sandwiches on the shelves, realised that each sandwich had two prices — one for eating in, and one for eating out. Quickly discovered that in Europe, sitting space has a premium; packing to go does not, which knocked me off balance for a bit because I'm more used to being caught wondering if getting that soup to go in Singapore would cost me another 20 cents for packaging.

Taught a class on trash, based on this reading:

Strasser, "Rags, Bones, and Plastic Bags: Obsolescence, Trash, and American Consumer Culture," in Babette B. Tischleder and Sarah Wasserman (ed.s), Cultures of Obsolescence: History, Materiality, and the Digital Age (NY: Palgrave MacMillan, 2015), pp. 41–60.
