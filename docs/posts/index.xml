      <description>I am thinking of The Binding of Isaac, Y combinators, recursion, and Marshall MacLuhan.
I had a long conversation about death with a good friend today over economy rice (I remember someone telling me that eating economy rice alone is the saddest thing in the world). Our conversation skirted the rims of the contingency of death, about how death doesn&amp;rsquo;t discriminate, and how the only thing that insulates you from death is either divine influence, or not caring.</description>

      <description>San Junipero made me cry. It made me cry because it&amp;rsquo;s a story about a pair of lovers dealing with trauma, loss, and pain. Tears constitute an involuntary emotional response to presented stimuli â€” stimuli that usually exceeds a certain emotional threshold. We cry with joy, relief, pain, hurt, etc. Working with that assumption, we also know that crying can be caused, and by extension, manufactured. San Junipero, and the rest of Black Mirror, manufactures its audiences&amp;rsquo; response to the series to produce an illusion of edification.</description>

      <description>Over time, repetition becomes variation.
 Westworld (2016) managed to hold my attention for more than 6 episodes &amp;ndash; 6 (now 9) hours that I feel must result in a product, or at least a short introspective into what held my attention in the series where I drift off drastically in others.
Here are a few thoughts:
Total surveillance is mundane.  There are no moments where surveillance becomes a source of horror.</description>
