    <p><a href="http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2013/03/9432/"><img src="/img/screen-shot-2014-02-27-at-3-41-50-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-27 at 3.41.50 am" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2013/03/9432/">Doug Mainwaring has written an article</a> on why same-sex marriages shouldn&rsquo;t be a thing, stating that it&rsquo;s a matter of semantics. <em>Marriage</em>, according to Mainwaring, is a term that is historically and culturally linked to heterosexual religious and legal unions. He says that we should leave the term &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; for the union of heterosexual couples, while homosexual couples should they want similar legal rights and recognition by the state/law should have &ldquo;civil unions&rdquo;. Which is all fine (we&rsquo;ve got to start somewhere) if being in a &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; accords the same rights to a couple as a &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; (as it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Partnership_Act_2004#Schedule_20">does</a> in <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmbills/168/2004168.htm">UK&rsquo;s Civil Partnership Act</a>). But Mainwaring&rsquo;s designation same-sex marriages as &ldquo;civil unions&rdquo; flat out seeks to deny validity of same-sex marriages. Period. He goes on about the oversexualized nature of (specifically) male homosexual culture and how same-sex marriages are simply &ldquo;implausible&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Hold that thought. It&rsquo;s apparently not his first article on homosexuality and marriage, so we&rsquo;ll go to one of the articles that he points us to, <a href="http://potomacteapartyreport.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/the-myth-of-the-same-sex-marriage-mandate/">also authored by Mainwaring himself</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He calls gay rights a &ldquo;faux-civil rights issue, diminishing the meaning of the centuries-long struggle by Blacks for equality&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>Homosexuals are being <a href="http://themattwalshblog.com/2014/02/25/yes-of-course-a-business-owner-should-have-the-right-to-refuse-service-to-gay-people/">denied service in Arizona</a>; them and their associates are being hunted in <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/25/world/africa/uganda-anti-gay-law/">Uganda</a> and <a href="http://www.globalequality.org/newsroom/latest-news/1-in-the-news/186-the-facts-on-lgbt-rights-in-russia">Russia</a>; under Singapore law, one can be imprisoned under <a href="http://www.singapolitics.sg/tags/377a">377A</a> for performing homosexual acts. And that&rsquo;s just scratching the surface. How is the gay rights movement a &ldquo;faux-civil rights issue&rdquo; then?




<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Conflating the issue of same-sex marriages and gay rights&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>My question is, how are these two not related? Is not the right to marry a right to be accorded to a human being?




<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Attempting to play the numbers game</p>

<ul>
<li>Mainwaring constantly attempts to use &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; to show us that there is no &ldquo;mandate&rdquo; by the LGBT community to push for the right to same-sex marriage, and he puts it forth as &ldquo;empirical fact&rdquo;. This is classic McNamara fallacy, where _he_ takes the number of same-sex marriages that are in place as an indicator of <em>the need to legally recognise same-sex marriages</em>. The leap in logic here is immense. Let me illustrate with a negative example: there are several endangered insects on the EEC&rsquo;s list that <a href="http://www.earthsendangered.com/donate-links.asp?nr=1&amp;donate=1">are not represented by any wildlife conservation fund of any sort</a>. Because they are not furry, do not have many adorable cartoon counterparts in the media, <strong>we are just going to let them die out</strong>. Let that sink in for a moment. Because there is no <em>popular mandate</em>, we&rsquo;re leaving entire species to die because of what we&rsquo;re doing to their habitats. <strong>Popular mandate is not, and should not, be a determinant in the well being of any living thing</strong> (and leaving such things to popular mandate, I would say, _is_ an <em>objective evil</em>).




<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;The meaning of marriage is immutable&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://foreigninfluence.com/2014/02/19/its-philip-and-bartholomew-on-religion-the-state-and-same-sex-unions/">Bergen-Aurand</a> points out that marriage has not always been an exclusively heterosexual institution. Marriage as a heterosexual institution is no more or less a social and religious construct as same-sex marriages, or the &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; that he puts forth. In addition, Mainwaring continues to play the numbers game, saying that &ldquo;[e]nsuring a better future for our children and grandchildren is more important than our generation’s desire to make history&rsquo;, citing the &ldquo;unraveling&rdquo; of the institution of marriage as a reason to, well, keep marriage laws as they are. And he tries to divert our attention to the statistic: &ldquo;40% of all births in the U.S. are to unwed parents&rdquo;. First of all, this has <strong>nothing to do with the validity of same-sex marriages</strong>, and <strong>very wrongheadedly reduces</strong> the issue of single-parenthood to the &ldquo;unraveling&rdquo; of marriage and flat out shutting out factors such as poverty, poor urban development, racial politics, crime etc. If anything, this illustrates the poor state of heterosexual marriages<em>which legislation has yet to fix thus far</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Coming back to the original article, we see that Mainwaring has added one more argument to his repertoire: that same-sex marriages are an &ldquo;objective evil&rdquo; because they deny children the affectations of parents of each gender:</p>

<blockquote>"Two men or two women together is, in truth, nothing like a man and a woman creating a life and a family together. Same-sex relationships are certainly very legitimate, rewarding pursuits, leading to happiness for many, but they are wholly different in experience and nature."</blockquote>

<p>I cannot argue against the idea that having both parents of the same sex would be objectively and qualitatively different from being brought up in a family where my parents are of opposite sex. I was brought up in the latter, and have no experience, anecdotal or otherwise, to tell me anything about the former. But what I cannot understand is the flat out decrying of same-sex marriage parenting as &ldquo;objective evil&rdquo;. You see how stuck on the phrase I am. Varied studies (that definitely come with their own biases and blind spots), such as that from the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/gay-parents-as-good-as-straight-ones/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, this well-researched article from <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/5-gay-parenting-myths.htm#page=0">How Stuff Works</a>, the <a href="http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=37&amp;articleid=108&amp;sectionid=701&amp;submit">APA</a>, and opponents such as <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/17/study-gay-parents-more-likely-to-have-gay-kids/">Walter Schumm</a> and this article from the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610">New Family Structures Study</a> show that the debate is far from settled. But saying that on the basis that &ldquo;denying&rdquo; children parents of opposite gender, to permanently etch &ldquo;deprivation&rdquo; on their hearts, and calling same-sex marriages genderless is again painfully reductive and over presumptive.</p>

<p>Because genderless-ness is a topic that is altogether different from same-gender parenthood, and one that requires a separate examination from that of same-gender marriage and parenthood. It is ironic that Mainwaring should state this because it shows that he does not fully understand the idea of &ldquo;fluidity&rdquo; in gender that he appears to acknowledge further down in his essay. Gender fluidity does not correspond to genderless-ness or changing preferences as and when — it is more related to what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc">Judith Butler posits as the performativity of gender</a>, and _is more complex_ than Mainwaring appears to have acknowledged. In addition, the idea that same-sex marriages that &ldquo;deprive&rdquo; children of a proper family is one that is &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is one that is not founded on fact thus far. As much as Mainwaring would like to, there is no &ldquo;empirical fact&rdquo; to support evil-ness. What we do have in same-sex marriages is a structure where partners of the same sex are entitled the legitimacy and peace of mind to raise a child the best they can, in the same way a heterosexual married couple would seek to.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>When I first came across Mainwaring&rsquo;s article on <em>The Public Discourse</em>, I was inclined to give it the benefit of doubt. I mean, every voice counts in a debate, and that&rsquo;s what discourse is about right? But only if the debate is informed and well substantiated. I would like to think that Mainwaring is as &ldquo;intellectually honest&rdquo; as he says he is, but I am starting to have my doubts after ploughing through the two articles above.</p>

<p>There are discourses on how humanity and society should progress, and how we should go about it, <strong>and then there are discourses on how we should treat fellow human beings, such as whether their union is legitimate or not</strong>. If you believe that your beliefs are &ldquo;infringed&rdquo; upon, or that agendas are being &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; upon you, please check your privilege before opening your mouth, or worse, pulling out your keyboard.</p>

<p>Edit: Of course, I&rsquo;m one to speak, being the part of the fortunate majority where I live. But I try (and I hope it&rsquo;s okay enough).</p>
