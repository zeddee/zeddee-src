<p><a href="http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2013/03/9432/">Doug Mainwaring has written an article</a> on why same-sex marriages shouldn&rsquo;t be a thing, stating that it&rsquo;s a matter of semantics. <em>Marriage</em>, according to Mainwaring, is a term that is historically and culturally linked to heterosexual religious and legal unions. He says that we should leave the term &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; for the union of heterosexual couples, while homosexual couples should they want similar legal rights and recognition by the state/law should have &ldquo;civil unions&rdquo;. Which is all fine (we&rsquo;ve got to start somewhere) if being in a &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; accords the same rights to a couple as a &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; (as it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Partnership_Act_2004#Schedule_20">does</a> in <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmbills/168/2004168.htm">UK&rsquo;s Civil Partnership Act</a>). But Mainwaring&rsquo;s designation same-sex marriages as &ldquo;civil unions&rdquo; flat out seeks to deny validity of same-sex marriages. Period. He goes on about the oversexualized nature of (specifically) male homosexual culture and how same-sex marriages are simply &ldquo;implausible&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hold that thought. It&rsquo;s apparently not his first article on homosexuality and marriage, so we&rsquo;ll go to one of the articles that he points us to, <a href="http://potomacteapartyreport.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/the-myth-of-the-same-sex-marriage-mandate/">also authored by Mainwaring himself</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>He calls gay rights a &ldquo;faux-civil rights issue, diminishing the meaning of the centuries-long struggle by Blacks for equality&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* Homosexuals are being [denied service in Arizona](http://themattwalshblog.com/2014/02/25/yes-of-course-a-business-owner-should-have-the-right-to-refuse-service-to-gay-people/); them and their associates are being hunted in [Uganda](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/25/world/africa/uganda-anti-gay-law/) and [Russia](http://www.globalequality.org/newsroom/latest-news/1-in-the-news/186-the-facts-on-lgbt-rights-in-russia); under Singapore law, one can be imprisoned under [377A](http://www.singapolitics.sg/tags/377a) for performing homosexual acts. And that's just scratching the surface. How is the gay rights movement a &quot;faux-civil rights issue&quot; then?

<li>&ldquo;Conflating the issue of same-sex marriages and gay rights&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* My question is, how are these two not related? Is not the right to marry a right to be accorded to a human being?
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Attempting to play the numbers game</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* Mainwaring constantly attempts to use &quot;statistics&quot; to show us that there is no &quot;mandate&quot; by the LGBT community to push for the right to same-sex marriage, and he puts it forth as &quot;empirical fact&quot;. This is classic McNamara fallacy, where _he_ takes the number of same-sex marriages that are in place as an indicator of _the need to legally recognise same-sex marriages_. The leap in logic here is immense. Let me illustrate with a negative example: there are several endangered insects on the EEC's list that [are not represented by any wildlife conservation fund of any sort](http://www.earthsendangered.com/donate-links.asp?nr=1&amp;donate=1). Because they are not furry, do not have many adorable cartoon counterparts in the media, **we are just going to let them die out**. Let that sink in for a moment. Because there is no _popular mandate_, we're leaving entire species to die because of what we're doing to their habitats. **Popular mandate is not, and should not, be a determinant in the well being of any living thing** (and leaving such things to popular mandate, I would say, _is_ an _objective evil_).
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>&ldquo;The meaning of marriage is immutable&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* [Bergen-Aurand](http://foreigninfluence.com/2014/02/19/its-philip-and-bartholomew-on-religion-the-state-and-same-sex-unions/) points out that marriage has not always been an exclusively heterosexual institution. Marriage as a heterosexual institution is no more or less a social and religious construct as same-sex marriages, or the &quot;civil union&quot; that he puts forth. In addition, Mainwaring continues to play the numbers game, saying that &quot;[e]nsuring a better future for our children and grandchildren is more important than our generation’s desire to make history', citing the &quot;unraveling&quot; of the institution of marriage as a reason to, well, keep marriage laws as they are. And he tries to divert our attention to the statistic: &quot;40% of all births in the U.S. are to unwed parents&quot;. First of all, this has **nothing to do with the validity of same-sex marriages**, and **very wrongheadedly reduces** the issue of single-parenthood to the &quot;unraveling&quot; of marriage and flat out shutting out factors such as poverty, poor urban development, racial politics, crime etc. If anything, this illustrates the poor state of heterosexual marriages_which legislation has yet to fix thus far_.
</code></pre>
<p>Coming back to the original article, we see that Mainwaring has added one more argument to his repertoire: that same-sex marriages are an &ldquo;objective evil&rdquo; because they deny children the affectations of parents of each gender:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I cannot argue against the idea that having both parents of the same sex would be objectively and qualitatively different from being brought up in a family where my parents are of opposite sex. I was brought up in the latter, and have no experience, anecdotal or otherwise, to tell me anything about the former. But what I cannot understand is the flat out decrying of same-sex marriage parenting as &ldquo;objective evil&rdquo;. You see how stuck on the phrase I am. Varied studies (that definitely come with their own biases and blind spots), such as that from the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/gay-parents-as-good-as-straight-ones/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, this well-researched article from <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/5-gay-parenting-myths.htm#page=0">How Stuff Works</a>, the <a href="http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=37&amp;articleid=108&amp;sectionid=701&amp;submit">APA</a>, and opponents such as <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/17/study-gay-parents-more-likely-to-have-gay-kids/">Walter Schumm</a> and this article from the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610">New Family Structures Study</a> show that the debate is far from settled. But saying that on the basis that &ldquo;denying&rdquo; children parents of opposite gender, to permanently etch &ldquo;deprivation&rdquo; on their hearts, and calling same-sex marriages genderless is again painfully reductive and over presumptive.</p>
<p>Because genderless-ness is a topic that is altogether different from same-gender parenthood, and one that requires a separate examination from that of same-gender marriage and parenthood. It is ironic that Mainwaring should state this because it shows that he does not fully understand the idea of &ldquo;fluidity&rdquo; in gender that he appears to acknowledge further down in his essay. Gender fluidity does not correspond to genderless-ness or changing preferences as and when — it is more related to what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc">Judith Butler posits as the performativity of gender</a>, and <em>is more complex</em> than Mainwaring appears to have acknowledged. In addition, the idea that same-sex marriages that &ldquo;deprive&rdquo; children of a proper family is one that is &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is one that is not founded on fact thus far. As much as Mainwaring would like to, there is no &ldquo;empirical fact&rdquo; to support evil-ness. What we do have in same-sex marriages is a structure where partners of the same sex are entitled the legitimacy and peace of mind to raise a child the best they can, in the same way a heterosexual married couple would seek to.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>When I first came across Mainwaring&rsquo;s article on <em>The Public Discourse</em>, I was inclined to give it the benefit of doubt. I mean, every voice counts in a debate, and that&rsquo;s what discourse is about right? But only if the debate is informed and well substantiated. I would like to think that Mainwaring is as &ldquo;intellectually honest&rdquo; as he says he is, but I am starting to have my doubts after ploughing through the two articles above.</p>
<p>There are discourses on how humanity and society should progress, and how we should go about it, <strong>and then there are discourses on how we should treat fellow human beings, such as whether their union is legitimate or not</strong>. If you believe that your beliefs are &ldquo;infringed&rdquo; upon, or that agendas are being &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; upon you, please check your privilege before opening your mouth, or worse, pulling out your keyboard.</p>
<p>Edit: Of course, I&rsquo;m one to speak, being the part of the fortunate majority where I live. But I try (and I hope it&rsquo;s okay enough).</p>
