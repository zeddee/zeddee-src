    <p>I found out that the National Library extended the average user&rsquo;s borrowing privileges, allowing them to borrow probably 60% more books than they usually could. Because I was sitting at 12 borrowed books at one time and desperately wanted to take home a well-worn issue of <em>LUCKY PEACH</em> (on ugly foods, if I remember correctly), I did my part as an active citizen and actually paid for a premium library membership &ndash; which has led to todays situation where I stand at a balance of 33/50 books borrowed.</p>

<p><code>Not pictured: an unruly pile of books that's creeping across the floor.</code></p>
<p>This, of course, makes up less than a tenth of the books that are actually in my room.</p>
<p>It also makes the title of this post sound pretty rich. But let me explain myself.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last two years buried in books because I&rsquo;ve always felt that I haven&rsquo;t read enough. You know the endless abyss that&rsquo;s the infinte Wiki trawl (clicking Wiki link after link)? That happens to me with books. What people usually spend on food and alcohol I spend on books (and expensive books at that). The unnerving part is this: that as much as I know I am making progress with the hardest and most obscure ideas in the world through the thousands of pages that sit on my shelves and desk(s), I know it will not matter to anyone until I make something.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t happened in 2 years. So maybe it&rsquo;ll happen this year if I read less. Maybe.</p>
