      <description>Doug Mainwaring has written an article on why same-sex marriages shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a thing, stating that it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of semantics. Marriage, according to Mainwaring, is a term that is historically and culturally linked to heterosexual religious and legal unions. He says that we should leave the term &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo; for the union of heterosexual couples, while homosexual couples should they want similar legal rights and recognition by the state/law should have &amp;ldquo;civil unions&amp;rdquo;.</description>

When I left the theatre, I heard the people next to me telling each other that they had &amp;ldquo;mixed feelings&amp;rdquo; about her. Granted, we&amp;rsquo;re probably not used to omniscient AI being portrayed in films as benevolent (and when they are, they&amp;rsquo;re given very human bodies 1), much less loving and capable of being loved.
But I won&amp;rsquo;t full-throttle into Wot-I-Think about her here. That will come perhaps at some other time.</description>
