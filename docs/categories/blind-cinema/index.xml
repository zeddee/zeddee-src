      <description>[Update 16 Jan 2016 to include the full essay]
  
Excerpt: We are caught in this enclosed room of &amp;ldquo;echoing voices&amp;rdquo;, like Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Samson (40), &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;en abyme&amp;rsquo; behind the walls of the eye&amp;rdquo; by the simultaneous visuality — the overwhelming &amp;ldquo;sensible&amp;rdquo; (55) blue-ness of the screen — and non-visuality of Jarman&amp;rsquo;s film. The diegesis of Jarman&amp;rsquo;s film consists of one frame and one visual mise-en-scene, but yet we experience something incommensurably beyond that frame; a film whose sound seems utterly dislocated from the image except for the association with the sensible colour blue.</description>

      <description>We often try to touch something to find out if it is really there. Material presence of an object is determined by its material tangibility, or in other words, &amp;ldquo;I can touch it, therefore it is there.
 Film theorists often looked to the &amp;ldquo;plastic&amp;rdquo; materiality of film, photographic and cinematic alike, as proof of their &amp;ldquo;here-ness&amp;rdquo;. This became of exceptional importance when it came to discussing the &amp;ldquo;realism&amp;rdquo; of the filmic image: that the plastic materiality of the filmic image would anchor its validity as index to its referent.</description>
