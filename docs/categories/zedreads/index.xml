      <description>“Suffering and Death”1 — Levinas Emmanuel Levinas, “Suffering and Death,” Time &amp;amp; the Other, trans. Richard A. Cohen (Pittsburg, Pennsylvania: Duquesne UP, 1987), p. 68–71.
(Text below is excerpted from &amp;ldquo;Suffering and Death&amp;rdquo;)
In pain, sorrow, and suffering, we once again find, in a state of purity, the finality that constitutes the tragedy of {page break; 68} solitude. The ecstasies of enjoyment does not succeed in surmounting this finality. Two points must be emphasized: I am going to pursue the analysis of solitude in the pain of need and work, not in the anxiety of nothingness; and I am going to lay stress on the pain lightly called physical, for in it engagement in existence without any equivocation.</description>

      <description>Strasser, Susan, “Rags, Bones, and Plastic Bags: Obsolescence, Trash, and American Consumer Culture,” in Babette B. Tischleder and Sarah Wasserman (ed.s), Cultures of Obsolescence: History, Materiality, and the Digital Age (NY: Palgrave MacMillan, 2015), pp. 41–60.
NB: Strasser’s research mostly reveals only what was happening in the US.
How the the growth of consumer culture can be traced through the history of trash:
“Stewardship of Objects and Materials” (42–45) Strasser charts the history of 19th-century household manuals — containing advice for housekeepers on maintenance of household objects.</description>

      <description>Consumerism 
The Consumption Reader Unless otherwise specified, all quotes are from the following text:
Clarke, David B., Doel, Marcus A., Housiaux, Kate M.L. (ed.) The Consumption Reader (London &amp;amp; NY: Routledge, 2003).
“General Introduction” p.1
 Introducing ‘consumption’ is a daunting task, not simply because there has been an explosion of writing and research on the topic over recent decades, but also because most people already feel they understand the term well enough.</description>

      <title>Notes on George Perec&#39;s Species of Spaces and Other Pieces</title>
      <link>https://www.zeddee.com/scratchpad/georges-perec-species-of-spaces/</link>

      <description>Perec, Georges, Species of Spaces and Other Pieces (Penguin Classics, 2008) Perec&amp;rsquo;s text here reads as a beautiful taxonomy of spaces, but markedly avoids writing this taxonomy as a list of definitions. Instead, he navigates and dances around the spaces that we take for granted, the spaces that remain invisible to us until someone like himself comes along and — with his two writerly hands — cups its and holds it up gently to our faces.</description>
