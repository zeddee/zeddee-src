      <description>You’re not going to find deep-sea fish if you’re staring between your legs while knee deep in the neighbour’s wading pool. And you’re probably not going to get gripping photographs of dust-covered residents of a post-apocalyptic Boston if you’re sending your photographer into a videogame.
 That’s the sort of misunderstanding that typically comes out of traditional media outlets attempting to import their practices and modes of production into a medium that it does not particularly lend itself to.</description>

      <description>I transcribed a YouTube video Ian Bogost&amp;rsquo;s WIRED talk on THE DESIGN OF GAMES and posted it on my Web Design and Technologies class blog. He touched on the material of play and the folly of the idea of &amp;ldquo;gamification,&amp;rdquo; both relevant in a world that&amp;rsquo;s been so intent on porting our physical world over to a virtual one without delving into what these practices really mean. A good watch if you&amp;rsquo;re into any sort of experience design and/or materialist philosophies.</description>
