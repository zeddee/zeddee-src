      <description>“Suffering and Death”1 — Levinas Emmanuel Levinas, “Suffering and Death,” Time &amp;amp; the Other, trans. Richard A. Cohen (Pittsburg, Pennsylvania: Duquesne UP, 1987), p. 68–71.
(Text below is excerpted from &amp;ldquo;Suffering and Death&amp;rdquo;)
In pain, sorrow, and suffering, we once again find, in a state of purity, the finality that constitutes the tragedy of {page break; 68} solitude. The ecstasies of enjoyment does not succeed in surmounting this finality. Two points must be emphasized: I am going to pursue the analysis of solitude in the pain of need and work, not in the anxiety of nothingness; and I am going to lay stress on the pain lightly called physical, for in it engagement in existence without any equivocation.</description>
