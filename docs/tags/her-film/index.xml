      <description>_ _
When I left the theatre, I heard the people next to me telling each other that they had &amp;ldquo;mixed feelings&amp;rdquo; about her. Granted, we&amp;rsquo;re probably not used to omniscient AI being portrayed in films as benevolent (and when they are, they&amp;rsquo;re given very human bodies 1), much less loving and capable of being loved.
But I won&amp;rsquo;t full-throttle into Wot-I-Think about her here. That will come perhaps at some other time.</description>
